# OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for receiving metrics from the exporter
# This example shows how to receive metrics via OTLP/HTTP and export them to various backends

receivers:
  # OTLP HTTP receiver for metrics from the enhance-indexing-s3-exporter
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

processors:
  # Batch processor for efficiency
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 100

  # Add resource attributes
  resource:
    attributes:
      - key: service.name
        value: enhance-indexing-s3-exporter
        action: upsert

exporters:
  # Export to stdout for debugging
  logging:
    verbosity: detailed

  # Export to Prometheus endpoint
  prometheus:
    endpoint: 0.0.0.0:8888

  # Example: Export to Honeycomb
  # Uncomment and configure with your API key
  # otlphttp/honeycomb:
  #   endpoint: https://api.honeycomb.io
  #   headers:
  #     x-honeycomb-team: ${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}
  #     x-honeycomb-dataset: exporter-metrics

  # Example: Export to another OTLP endpoint
  # otlp/backend:
  #   endpoint: your-backend:4317
  #   tls:
  #     insecure: false

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch, resource]
      exporters: [logging, prometheus]
      # Add your exporters here: [logging, prometheus, otlphttp/honeycomb]

  # Enable telemetry for the collector itself
